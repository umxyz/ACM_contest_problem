# Censor

frog is now a editor to censor so-called sensitive words (敏感词).

She has a long text $p$.
Her job is relatively simple --
just to find the first occurence of sensitive word $w$ and remove it.

frog repeats over and over again.
Help her do the tedious work.

## Input

The input consists of multiple tests. For each test:

The first line contains $1$ string $w$.
The second line contains $1$ string $p$.

($1 \leq \textrm{length of}\ w, p \leq 5 \cdot 10^6$,
$w, p$ consists of only lowercase letter)

## Output

For each test, write $1$ string which denotes the censored text.
