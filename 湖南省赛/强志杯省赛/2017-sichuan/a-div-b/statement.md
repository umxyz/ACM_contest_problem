# Simple Arithmetic

Given $a$ and $b$ which both fit in $64$-bit signed integers, find $\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor$ where $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the largest integer which is not larger than $x$.

## Input

The input contains zero or more test cases and is terminated by end-of-file.

Each test case contains two integers $a, b$.

* $-2^{63} \leq a, b < 2^{63}$
* $b \neq 0$
* The number of tests cases does not exceed $10^4$.

## Output

For each case, output an integer which denotes the result.
