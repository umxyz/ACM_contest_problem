\begin{problem}{Matrix Transformation}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{1024 megabytes}

Bobo has a matrix of $n$ rows and $n$ columns.
The rows are numbered by $0, 1, \dots, (n - 1)$ from top to bottom,
and the columns are numbered by $0, 1, \dots, (n - 1)$ from left to right.
The cell in the intersection of the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column is denoted as $(i, j)$.
For each cell $(i, j)$, there is a number $i \times n + j$ written in.

Bobo is going to perform $q$ transformations successively.
The transformations are of $2$ kinds. 
The $i$-th transformation is of $t_i$-th kind, and it's described by $3$ parameters $l_i, r_i, d_i$.

If $t_i = 1$, the number in cell $(x, (y + d_i) \bmod n)$ where $l_i \leq x \leq r_i, 0 \leq y < n$ will be transferred to the cell $(x, y)$ by the transformation. 

If $t_i = 2$, the number in cell $((x + d_i) \bmod n, y)$ where $0 \leq x < n, l_i \leq y \leq r_i$ will be transferred to the cell $(x, y)$ by the transformation. 

Note that $a \bmod b$ means the remainder of $a$ after division by $b$.

Bobo would like to know the final configuration of the matrix.

\InputFile
The first line contains $2$ integers $n, q$ ($1 \leq n \leq 200, 1 \leq q \leq 10^5$). 

The $i$-th of the following $q$ lines contains $4$ integers $t_i, l_i, r_i, d_i$ ($t_i \in \{1, 2\}, 0 \leq l_i \leq r_i < n, 0 \leq d_i < n$). 

\OutputFile
$n$ lines. The $i$-th line contains $n$ integers $a_{i, 0}, a_{i, 1}, \dots, a_{i, n - 1}$ which denotes the final number in cell $(i, j)$.
