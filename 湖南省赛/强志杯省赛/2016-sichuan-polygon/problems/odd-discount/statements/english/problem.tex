\begin{problem}{Odd Discount}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{1024 megabytes}

In the store of ICPCCamp, there are $n$ items to be sold with $m$ bundles offered.

The $i$-th bundle is described by $c_i$ and $k_i$ \textbf{distinct} integers $a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \dots, a_{i, k_i}$.
It means that one gets $c_i$ dollars discount if among the $a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \dots, a_{i, k_i}$-th items, he buys exactly odd number of them. Bundles can be combined.

Bobo wants to buy a non-empty subset of the items.
It is clear there are $(2^n - 1)$ different sets for him.
Find out $(d_1^2 + d_2^2 + \dots + d_{2^n - 1}^2)$ modulo $(10^9+7)$ where $d_i$ is the sum of discount for the $i$-th set.

\InputFile
The first line contains $2$ integers $n, m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 20, 1 \leq m \leq 10^5$). 

The $i$-th of the following $m$ lines contains integers $c_i, k_i$, followed by $k_i$ integers $a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \dots, a_{i, k_i}$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 10^4, 1 \leq a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \dots, a_{i, k_i} \leq n$). 

\OutputFile
An integer denotes $(d_1^2+d_2^2+\dots+d_{2^n-1}^2)$ modulo $(10^9+7)$.

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmp{2 2
1 1 1
2 2 1 2
}{14
}%
\exmp{1 1
1 1 1
}{1
}%
\end{example}

\Note
In the first sample, there are $3$ possibilities for Bobo.
\begin{itemize}
\item He buys the first item and uses both bundles.
\item He buys the second item and uses the second bundle solely.
\item He buys both items and uses the first bundle.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, $d_1 = 3, d_2 = 2, d_3 = 1$ and $d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = 14$.
