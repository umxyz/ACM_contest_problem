\begin{problem}{Road History}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{1024 megabytes}

Bobo is studying the history of roads in ICPCCamp.
In ICPCCamp, there are $n$ cities with $m$ bidirectional roads.
The $i$-th road connects the $a_i$-th and $b_i$-th cities.

There were no roads initially.
Eventually, roads were built in the order $1, 2, \dots m$. 
 
Bobo would like to know the number of pairs of cities which allow an \textit{odd drive} after the $i$-th road was built.
An \textit{odd drive} between cities $u$ and $v$ is possible only if there exists $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{2k}$ for some positive integers $k$ such that $v_1 = u, v_{2k} = v$ and there is a road connecting cities $v_i$ and $v_{i + 1}$. Passing by a city more than once is allowed. 

\InputFile
The first line contains $2$ integers $n, m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5$). 

The $i$-th of the following $m$ lines contains $2$ integers $a_i, b_i$ ($1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq n$). 

\OutputFile
$m$ lines with integers $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_m$ where $w_i$ denotes the number of pairs allowing an odd drive after the $i$-th road was built.
