# Gambling

In ICPCCamp, gambling is conducted as follow.
A player will draw balls from an opaque bag containing $a$ red balls, $b$ green balls and $c$ blue balls initially.
Balls in the bag will be drawn in equal probability while drawn balls won't be put back into the bag.
The player continues the process until he collects all $a$ red balls, or all $b$ green balls, or all $c$ blue balls.
He ends up with First Prize if he collects $a$ red balls, or Second Prize if he collects $b$ green balls, or Third Prize otherwise.

Bobo is going to take part in the above gambling.
Therefore, it is very important for him to work out the probability of winning each prize.

## Input

The input contains at most $40$ sets. For each set:

Three integers $a, b, c$ ($1 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^3$).

## Output

For each set, three irreducible fractions $p_A, p_B, p_C$ denote the probability of winning First Price, Second Price, and Third Price, respectively.
