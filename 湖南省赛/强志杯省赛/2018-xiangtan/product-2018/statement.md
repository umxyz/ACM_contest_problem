# 2018

Given $a, b, c, d$, find out the number of pairs of integers $(x, y)$ where $a \leq x \leq b, c \leq y \leq d$ and $x \cdot y$ is a multiple of $2018$.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases and is terminated by end-of-file.

Each test case contains four integers $a, b, c, d$.

## Output

For each test case, print an integer which denotes the result.

## Constraint

* $1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^9, 1 \leq c \leq d \leq 10^9$
* The number of tests cases does not exceed $10^4$.
