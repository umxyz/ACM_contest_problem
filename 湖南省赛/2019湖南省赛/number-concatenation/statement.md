# Numbers

Bobo has $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ in $[0, 99]$.
He writes them in decimal notation without leading zeros in a row, obtaning a string $s$.

Given the string $s$, find the number of possible array of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases and is terminated by end-of-file.

Each test case contains a string $s$.

* $1 \leq |s| \leq 50$
* There are at most $100$ test cases.

## Output

For each test case, print an integer which denotes the result.
